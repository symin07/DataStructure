/* Define this function, type casting the value of void * to the desired type.
   The current definition of TYPE in bst.h is void*, which means that left and
   right are void pointers. To compare left and right, you should first cast
   left and right to the corresponding pointer type (struct data *), and then
   compare the values pointed by the casted pointers.

   Return value:
	-1 if left < right return
	 1 if left > right return
	 0 if left = right return
  
   DO NOT compare the addresses pointed by left and right, i.e. "if (left < right)",
   which is really wrong.
